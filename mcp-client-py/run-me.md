Thank you for providing the paths! Let's update the .env file with the correct paths from your JSON config:

````text:mcp-client-py/.env
# Server path - points to your filesystem server
SERVER_PATH=/Users/dazzagreenwood/filesystem/dist/index.js

# Allowed directory - your test directory
ALLOWED_DIRECTORY=/Users/dazzagreenwood/mcp-hello/module1/files
````

Now let's set up and test the MCP client:

1. First, create the project directory and files if you haven't already:
```bash
mkdir mcp-client-py
cd mcp-client-py
```

2. Create the virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the client in default mode to test write_file:
```bash
python client.py
```

This should:
- Connect to your filesystem server at `/Users/dazzagreenwood/filesystem/dist/index.js`
- Create a test.txt file in `/Users/dazzagreenwood/mcp-hello/module1/files`
- Show you the available tools and the result of the write operation

If you want to verify it worked, you can check the contents of the test file:
```bash
cat /Users/dazzagreenwood/mcp-hello/module1/files/test.txt
```

Let me know if you run into any issues or once this basic test is working and we can move on to testing other tools!
